<% if @feed_items.any? %>

    <%= render @feed_items %>
  </ol>
  <%= will_paginate @feed_items %>
  <!-- If there was no route for '/microposts' defined, clicking the page button
  after invalid micropost input (/microposts?page=2) would result in an error
  because there is no index action in Microposts controller. To solve it (apart
  from adding a route '/microposts' in routes.rb) you can do:

  will_paginate @feed_items, params: { controller: :static_pages,
                                       action:     :home } -->
